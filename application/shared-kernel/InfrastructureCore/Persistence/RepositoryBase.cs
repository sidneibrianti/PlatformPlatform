///     RepositoryBase contains implementations for generic repository features. Repositories are a DDD concept, and are
///     used as an abstraction over the database. In DDD, repositories are used to persist <see cref="IAggregateRoot" />.
///     <see cref="Entity{T}" /> that are not aggregates cannot be fetched from the database using a repository. They
///     must be fetched indirectly by fetching the aggregate that they belong to. E.g., to fetch an OrderLine entity,
///     you must do it by fetching the Order aggregate that it belongs to.
///     Repositories are not responsible for commiting the changes to the database, which is handled by the
///     <see cref="IUnitOfWork" />. What this means is that when you add, update, or delete aggregates, they are just
///     marked to be added, updated, or deleted, and it's not until the <see cref="IUnitOfWork" /> is committed that the
///     changes are actually persisted to the database.
